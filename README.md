# GameLog

- Backend API developed in .NET 8 using the Clean Architecture with  Domain-Driven Design and CQRS using MediatR

## What is GameLog?
- GameLog is an idea that i had at the end of 2023 when i tried to remember all the games that i played and what i thought of them, but obsviously i couldn't.
- Then i started to log everything that i am playing or want to play on the future on an excel worksheet, but excel is boring and sometimes can be troublesome to do some adjustments that i wanted.
- So, finally, i started this project with the hope that i can help someone out there that has the same wish that i had, of logging their experiences and maybe even sharing with their friends.
