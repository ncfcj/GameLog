# GameLog

- Backend API developed in .NET 8 using the Clean Architecture with  Domain-Driven Design and CQRS using MediatR

## What is GameLog?
- GameLog is an idea that i had at the end of 2023 when i tried to remember all the games that i played and what i thought of them, but obsviously i couldn't. Then i started to log everything that i am playing or want to play on the future on an excel worksheet, but excel is boring. And with that, i started developing this app that can help me and any other gamer out there that wants to have a log about their gaming experience.
